# SpringBoot-CloudEvents

[Cloudevents](https://cloudevents.io) is a specification for describing event data in a common way. 
It is part of [CNCF](cncf.io) and it's gaining support from the community.

This library adds cloudevents support to Spring JMS.

Note: cloudevents released a [CloudEvents Spring](https://cloudevents.github.io/sdk-java/spring) which apparently does the same thing.
